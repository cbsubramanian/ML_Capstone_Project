## Instructions
## Now that you have been equipped with the skills to use different Machine Learning algorithms, over the course of five weeks, you will have the opportunity to practice and apply it on a dataset. In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.
## You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:
## k-Nearest Neighbour
## Decision Tree
## Support Vector Machine
## Logistic Regression
## The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
## Jaccard index
## F1-score
## LogLoss

This project exposes the basics of Python ML Programming and using the classification methods and accuracy score to determine and analyze the bank load data set. 
The file ML_Final_Project.ipynb is the notebook (Jupyter) code for implementing the project. It uses the load_train.csv for the full training data set and load_test.csv for the test set. 

The final accuracy score matric is showed using Jaccard Index, F1-score and LogLoss. 
The logic regression still is providing a decent correlation and a larger data set and correct sampling would provide more better accuracy of prediction. 
In this experimental analysis KNN seems to be giving the best accuracy closer to 80%. 

Mydecisiontree.png is the final output of my decision tree classification algorithm on the loan data set.
